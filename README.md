# Hangout.Chat.Bot
A JAVA implementation of the backend for an Hangout Chat bot using Pub/Sub tech


## Prototype for testing Google Pub/Sub and Hangout Chat
First prototype - code is not refactored or optimized. I just got the pub/sub working. And since a had trouble getting the example code from google to work I add my prototype code here for further references. 

## Hangout Chat API config
More info is coming

But remember that the Cloud Pub/Sub Id is the complete string included "project/{project-id}/topics/{topic-id}"
